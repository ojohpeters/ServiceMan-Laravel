CPANEL - FIX INDEX-OF DIRECTORY LISTING
===========================================

PROBLEM: Seeing directory listing instead of your Laravel site.

SOLUTION: Point subdomain document root to public folder

METHOD 1: Change Document Root in cPanel (RECOMMENDED)

1. Log into cPanel
2. Go to "Subdomains" (under "Domains" section)
3. Find "serviceman.sekimbi.com"
4. Click on it or click "Manage"
5. Look for "Document Root" field
6. Change it from:
   /home/sekionzy/serviceman.sekimbi.com
   
   To:
   /home/sekionzy/serviceman.sekimbi.com/public

7. Save/Update
8. Wait 1-2 minutes for changes to propagate
9. Refresh your site

METHOD 2: If you can't change document root, update .htaccess

Make sure this .htaccess exists in:
/home/sekionzy/serviceman.sekimbi.com/.htaccess

Content:
---
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    
    # Redirect everything to public directory
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/public/
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ public/$1 [L]
    
    # If accessing root directly, serve public/index.php
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/$
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ public/index.php [L]
</IfModule>

# Prevent directory listing
Options -Indexes
---

Then test your site again.

VERIFY:
After fixing, visit: http://serviceman.sekimbi.com
You should see your Laravel home page, NOT directory listing.
