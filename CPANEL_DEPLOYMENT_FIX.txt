CPANEL DEPLOYMENT - FIX INDEX-OF ERROR
===========================================

PROBLEM: Getting "index-of" page instead of your Laravel site.

This happens because cPanel is serving files from the wrong directory.
Laravel's public folder must be your document root.

SOLUTION 1: Move files to correct structure (RECOMMENDED)

1. Via cPanel File Manager or SSH, go to:
   /home/sekionzy/serviceman.sekimbi.com/

2. Current structure (WRONG):
   serviceman.sekimbi.com/
     ├── app/
     ├── public/
     ├── routes/
     └── ... (all Laravel files)

3. Extract your zip to a temp location, then organize:

   OPTION A: If your subdomain root is already serviceman.sekimbi.com/
   
   Move all Laravel root files (app, bootstrap, config, etc.) to:
   /home/sekionzy/serviceman.sekimbi.com/
   
   Then move contents of public/ folder to public_html/:
   
   mkdir -p /home/sekionzy/public_html
   cp -r /home/sekionzy/serviceman.sekimbi.com/public/* /home/sekionzy/public_html/
   
   Update public/index.php to point to correct paths:
   require __DIR__.'/../../serviceman.sekimbi.com/vendor/autoload.php';
   $app = require_once __DIR__.'/../../serviceman.sekimbi.com/bootstrap/app.php';

   OPTION B: Point subdomain document root to public folder (BETTER)
   
   In cPanel:
   1. Go to "Subdomains"
   2. Find "serviceman.sekimbi.com"
   3. Click "Change"
   4. Set Document Root to: serviceman.sekimbi.com/public
   5. Save

SOLUTION 2: Update public/index.php paths

Edit /home/sekionzy/serviceman.sekimbi.com/public/index.php:

Change these lines:
require __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';
$app = require_once __DIR__.'/../bootstrap/app.php';

To (adjust path if needed):
require __DIR__.'/../../serviceman.sekimbi.com/vendor/autoload.php';
$app = require_once __DIR__.'/../../serviceman.sekimbi.com/bootstrap/app.php';

SOLUTION 3: Use .htaccess to redirect (QUICK FIX)

Create .htaccess in serviceman.sekimbi.com/ root:

RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/public/
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /public/$1 [L]

Then access your site. It should work!

VERIFY:
After fixing, visit: http://serviceman.sekimbi.com
You should see your Laravel app, not directory listing.
